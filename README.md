# MakeChangeProject

## Description
### This program acts like a cash register, displaying proper change and bill/coin denominations based on the price of a product and the amount of money given by the customer.

### To use this program, simply input the price of the item, followed by how much money the customer tendered.

## Technologies used
### For this program, I used two classes in eclipse. One for the program itself and one as a sandbox for experimenting with code.

## What I learned
### While building this program, I learned that it can be very difficult to establish the logic for what seems like simple calculations. I also learned how to nest if states in if statements and in for loops. And most importantly, I gained much experience troubleshooting my code.
